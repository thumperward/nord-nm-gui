## About

NordVPN Network Manager GUI is a graphical frontend for both NordVPN and the
system Network Manager. All connections are handled directly by the network
manager and user secrets are only stored in memory before being passed to the
Network Manager. Currently it operates 100% as a user process with no need for
root privileges.

This project was inspired by
[NordVPN-NetworkManager](https://github.com/Chadsr/NordVPN-NetworkManager) by
Chadsr. Many thanks for the code and knowledge that they published into the
public domain.

## Features

-   Clean - All configuration files are deleted after disconnection
-   Secure - User secrets are passed directly from memory to the Network
    manager, root access is not required
-   Powerful - Supports a variety of different protocols and server types with

## Using Installation Script

Installation script should support Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux. It will
attempt to install the one dependency this program has
(networkmanager-openvpn). It will also add a menu entry pointing to the current
working directory of the installation script. So make sure you place the folder
where you want the install to be located.

__Installation script is only intended for the release version__, not the
python script itself.

Usage: `sudo ./install.sh`

[You can download the latest release here.](https://github.com/vfosterm/NordVPN-NetworkManager-Gui/releases/latest)
